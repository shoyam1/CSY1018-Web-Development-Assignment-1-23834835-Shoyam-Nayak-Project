        <h1>Overall Experience</h1>
        <p class="paragraph">As a beginner it was completely new topics and a different environment to get started with
            my assignment.At first i created my account in github. After that i downloaded Visual Studio Code and
            started my
            assignment. For the color theme of home page i took the color code from color hunt. I have used the same
            color code for each and every page of my assignment. After that i created a repository in github. Inside
            that repository i created a branch from master for each of the pages in my assignment and made my first
            commit in that repository. For the purpose of making my assignment look attractive, i took reference from
            google font. Creating the home page was really tough for me as i was not used to with all these coding and i
            had a really tough time researching and gaining knowledge about the development. After that creating
            portfolio page was a easy task for me as i was getting usedto with CSS, html and github. I included my
            details in portfolio page. Creating contact page was also a easy task . We were already taught how to make a
            form in class so it was easy creating the contact page . Writing blog was a different topic which i had
            never tried before.I included everything how i started my assignment, mistakes i made while doing the
            assignment in my blog page. It was a completely new expirence which i enjoyed alot discovering it. I really
            enjoyed doing my assignment and using Github, VS code and many more.It gave me an opportunity to explore the
            field which i never had an idea about. </p><br><br>
